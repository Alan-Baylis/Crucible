# Crucible
A roguelike development kit designed and implemented in Unity with prefabs and scripts to easily implement a system for a procedurally generated game.

"Crucible" is designed for Unity version 5.3.0f and up. If there are any unexpected problems, please use the latest stable version of Unity and Crucible before reporting a bug.

Crucible hopes to achieve 5 major points during it's development:
  1) Create a robust framework to develop 2D tile-based games from.
  2) Allow users fast and easy access to tools they may use at any stage during their games development.
  3) Free developers from copious amounts of needless script writing, allowing them to focus on more important tasks.
  4) Be well maintained, to the latest versions of Unity.
  5) Be well documented and suitable for large-scale development use.
  
Crucible is a symbolic name. As a crucible is used to hold extremely hot materials in the use of production, so too shall Crucible be used to forge new experiences procedurally for developers use and gamers enjoyment.
